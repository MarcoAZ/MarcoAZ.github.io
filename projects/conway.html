			<p>The program creates a window into a seemingly infinite world where cells live or die depending on the status of its neighbors. The cell dies if there are only 1 or fewer live neighbors or more than 3. If there are exactly 3 live neighbors, the cell is born or stays alive. There are a few options for starting configurations. After the number of requested generations, the user can stop the program there or continue with more generations. </p>

			<p>TThe assignment seemed very daunting at first but after reading each requirement and breaking it down into simpler steps, it become much more manageable. Taking the time to design it before jumping in gave me a clearer view into what needed to be done. However, it seems I would have profited from spending just a little more on the design. I had not designed the configurations thoroughly beforehand. I wrote out ideas for what configurations I wanted but did not take the time to consider how I would enter them in. The way I had to do it was by brute-force. I set every cell I needed alive, one at a time. This was long and tedious. If I had spent some more time designing this, I could have saved myself some a lot of boring work. Whenever there is repetition in coding, it means there is usually a better way to go about it. If I had spent that extra time designing, I could have found an elegant solution.</p>
